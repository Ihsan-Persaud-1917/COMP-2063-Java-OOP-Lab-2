Lab 2 – Fuel Station Simulation
Course

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Lab Description

This lab builds on foundational OOP concepts by implementing a simple fuel station simulation. The objective was to design interacting Java classes that model real-world entities, apply encapsulation, and handle file input.

The program reads vehicle data from a file, stores the vehicles using an ArrayList, and simulates fuel dispensing based on fuel type compatibility and tank capacity. Exception handling is used to manage file input errors.
